According to Oliveira et al. [2021], DevRel is a strategic function within organizations that
focuses on building and maintaining relationships with developer communities, partner com-
panies, and other key stakeholders. DevRel teams are responsible for creating and executing
programs that engage and support developers, as well as promoting the organization's products,
services, and brand within the developer community.


In essence, DevRel is about establishing trust and credibility with developers by providing
them with the resources, tools, and support they need to be successful. This involves working
closely with developers to understand their needs and challenges, as well as communicating
the organization's goals and values in a way that resonates with the community. DevRel can
be thought of as a bridge between the technical and business sides of an organization. By
fostering strong relationships with the developer community, DevRel teams can help drive
business outcomes such as increased adoption of products and services, improved customer
satisfaction, and stronger brand loyalty.


DevRel is also closely associated with open-source software development, where communi-
ties of developers collaborate and contribute to a shared codebase. By building relationships
with these communities, DevRel teams can leverage the knowledge and expertise of the open-
source ecosystem to drive innovation and growth within the organization and the broader
tech industry.
